This repository holds a small sample from the Practical Symbolic Execution course. The included slides are the visuals that go along with the lecture about using symbolic execution to generate diverting tests cases. Also included in this repository is the associated `testcase_demo` lab that will allow students to start to play with this concept, as well as some solutions using MAAT and Triton.

To build the demo, simply run `make` inside of the `testcase_demo` directory. The solutions require MAAT or Triton to be installed in order to run.

The `triton_solve.py` and `maat_solve.py` solutions use MAAT or Triton, respectively, as the symbolic execution libraries. The different MAAT solutions showcase a few different ways to approach the problem using MAAT.
