# Practical Symbolic Execution For VR and RE
## Test-Case Generation Sample

This repository holds a small sample from the Practical Symbolic Execution course.
The included slides are used during lecture about generating diverging test cases with symbolic execution. Also included is the associated `testcase_demo` lab that will allow students to start to play with this concept. Multiple solutions are provided, solving the lab using [MAAT](https://maat.re/) and [Triton](https://triton-library.github.io/).

### Building

To build the demo, simply run `make` inside of the `testcase_demo` directory on a x86-64 Linux machine. The solutions require MAAT or Triton to be installed in order to run. In the course, students are provided with a premade environment with all the dependancies.

The different solutions provided showcase a few different ways to approach the problem.
